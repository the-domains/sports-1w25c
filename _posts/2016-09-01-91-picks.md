**9/1 Picks:**

* Marlins +185 (_1u_)
* Cubs -143 (_2u_)
* Twins +107 (_1u_)

Three night games and action on all three. Should be a fun night! Be sure to check out the new page ([The Model][0]) for a closer look at the model.

**9/1 Results:**

* Marlins 6 - Mets 4 (_+1.85u_)
* Giants 4 - Cubs 5 (_+2u_)
* White Sox 5 - Twins 8 (_+1.07u_)
* **3-0 (**_**+4.92u**_**)**

Perfect night! Not really a problem in any of the games. Cubs had to come from behind in the 7th but outhit the Giants 8-3\.
