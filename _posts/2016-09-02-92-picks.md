**9/2 Picks:**

Have the Cubs winning pretty easily for the day game, but not enough of an edge on the line to make a bet. Will be back later with the night games.

* Pirates -166 (_1u_)
* Cardinals -126 (_2u_)
* Twins +101 (_1u_)
* Rockies +109 (_2u_)

Will be back with more as lineups are released.
