**9/2 Picks:**

Have the Cubs winning pretty easily for the day game, but not enough of an edge on the line to make a bet. Will be back later with the night games.

* Pirates -166 (_1u_)
* Cardinals -126 (_2u_)
* Twins +101 (_1u_)
* Rockies +109 (_2u_)
* Red Sox -151 (_1u_)
* Dodgers -240 (_1u_)

Full card for tonight. -240 is the highest line I've played all season I believe, but we have a 3.39% edge on that line.
