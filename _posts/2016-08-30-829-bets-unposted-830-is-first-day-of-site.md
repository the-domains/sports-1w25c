**8/29 Picks** (Unposted - 8/30 is first day of site):

* Orioles +131 (_2u_)
* Phillies +185 (_1u_)
* Marlins -153 (_2u_)
* Rangers -151 (_1u_)
* Rockies +121 (_5u_)

Rockies were the first 5u play in well over a week. My model gives an 11.67% edge over the posted odds of 45.25% (in order to break even on +121, you need to win 45.25% of the time, my model says we win this bet 56.92%). That is a huge edge.

**8/29 Results:**

* Blue Jay 5 - Orioles 1 (_-2u_)
* Nationals 4 - Phillies 0 (_-1u_)
* Marlins 1 - Mets 2 (_-3.06u_)
* Rangers 6 - Mariners 3 (_+1u_)
* Dodgers 1 - Rockies 8 (_+6.05u_)
* **2-3 (**_**+0.99u**_**)**

Decent day, but definitely not as big as it could have been. The 5u swing on the Marlins in 10 innings hurt, especially when they were up 1-0 in the 8th and gave up a run on a wild pitch. Will not count in the running total since the games were not posted. Check back before the 7:05 PM ET games tonight for all the plays for today!
