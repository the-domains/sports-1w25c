8/29 Bets (Unposted - 8/30 is first day of site)

* Orioles +131 2u
* Phillies +185 1u
* Marlins -153 2u
* Rangers -151 1u
* Rockies +121 5u

Rockies were the first 5u play in well over a week. My model gives an 11.67% edge over the posted odds of 45.25% (in order to break even on +121, you need to win 45.25% of the time, my model says we win this bet 56.92%). That's a huge edge.

8/29 Results

* Blue Jay 5 - Orioles 1 -2u
* Nationals 4 - Phillies 0 -1u
* Marlins 1 - Mets 2 -3.06u
* Rangers 6 - Mariners 3 +1u
* Dodgers 1 - Rockies 8 +6.05u
* 2-3 +0.99u

Decent day, but definitely not as big as it could have been. The 5u swing on the Marlins in 10 innings hurt, especially when they were up 1-0 in the 8th and gave up a run on a wild pitch. Will not count in the running total since the games were not posted. Check back before the 7:05 PM ET games tonight for all the plays for today!
