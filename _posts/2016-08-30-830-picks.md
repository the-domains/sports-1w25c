8/30 Picks:

* Orioles +135 (1u)
* Marlins +114 (1u)
* Twins +195 (2u)
* Royals +126 (1u)
* Rockies +103 (5u)

5 dogs tonight and no favs. Not sure if the model has had that happen yet or not. Lots of teams close to a play (Nationals, Tigers, Red Sox, Astros (-175 when I saw line, know it's changed), Diamondbacks) if you're looking for more action. Let's go!

8/30 Results:

* Blue Jays 3 - Orioles 5 (+1.35u)
* Marlins 4 - Mets 7 (-1u)
* Twins 4 - Indians 5 (-2u)
* Yankees 5 - Royals 4 (-1u)
* Dodgers - Rockies POSTPONED (0u)
* 1-3 -2.65u

Brutal night. Twins had bases loaded with 1 out and GIDP. They were also up 4-1\. Royals lost in extras. We had a huge edge on the Rockies game and got postponed.
