**8/30 Picks:**

* Orioles +135 (_1u_)
* Marlins +114 (_1u_)
* Twins +195 (_2u_)
* Royals +126 (_1u_)
* Rockies +103 (_5u_)

5 dogs tonight and no favs. Not sure if the model has had that happen yet or not. Lots of teams close to a play (Nationals, Tigers, Red Sox, Astros (-175 when I saw line, know it's changed), Diamondbacks) if you're looking for more action. Let's go!

**8/30 Results:**

* Blue Jays 3 - Orioles 5 (_+1.35u_)
* Marlins 4 - Mets 7 (_-1u_)
* Twins 4 - Indians 5 (_-2u_)
* Yankees 5 - Royals 4 (_-1u_)
* Dodgers - Rockies POSTPONED (_0u_)
* **1-3 -2.65u**

Brutal night. Twins had bases loaded with 1 out and GIDP. They were also up 4-1\. Royals lost in extras. We had a huge edge on the Rockies game and got postponed.
