  Hey guys! Finally have a site up and running to post some picks! Iâ€™m a model
  MLB bettor meaning I built a model to predict the outcome of MLB games. I will
  only place a bet if I have an edge over the line. My bets range from 1u to
  10u. A play over 2u is very rare. It is always best to use a 100u bankroll,
  but a 50u bankroll should be large enough for my style of betting. All bets
  will be placed on the ML. Thanks for reading and have fun tailing!
