**The Model**

The model was developed using projected wOBA, Def, FIP, and some other components. There is obviously a lot that goes into a baseball game; matchups, weather, park, all kinds of things. What I built takes all this into consideration and comes up with a winning percentage for each team. They are then put up against each other using Bill James's log5 method to determine the win probability for the game.

Above is the output for the Sept. 1 early game between the Padres and Braves. It is showing that the Braves have a small edge over the -140 line, but not quite big enough of an edge to place a bet. If we bet every small edge, we would have a bet on nearly every single game. That can be swingy for a bankroll.

_Why are the Padres so bad today?_ Jarred Cosart has a 4.58 xFIP and the Padres bullpen isn't much better. They also have a negative Defense lineup. They get a small plus on the basepaths, but it's not a good sign when you're second best hitter is Oswaldo Arcia.

_Why are the Braves a .500 team today?_ Foltynewicz and the bullpen aren't that much worse than league average. While they do have a negative lineup and slightly negative defense, after you factor in home field advantage, you get them to a .500 team.

The result of the game was **9-6 Braves**. The game wasn't as close as the score with the Padres scoring 3 in the 9th. Cosart struggled early and often as the model predicted.
