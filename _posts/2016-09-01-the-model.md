**The Model**

The model was developed using projected wOBA, Def, FIP, and some other components. There is obviously a lot that goes into a baseball game; matchups, weather, park, all kinds of things. What I built takes all this into consideration and comes up with a winning percentage for each team. They are then put up against each other using Bill James's log5 method to determine the win probability for the game. Above is the output for the Sept. 1 early game between the Padres and Braves. It is showing that the Braves have a small edge over the -140 line, but not quite big enough of an edge to place a bet. If we bet every small edge, we would have a bet on nearly every single game. That can be swingy for a bankroll.
